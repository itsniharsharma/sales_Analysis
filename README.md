I was tasked with analyzing Diwali sales data to uncover insights and make predictions aimed at improving future sales performance. This project involved utilizing various data analysis tools and techniques to identify trends, customer preferences, and actionable strategies.

The scope of the project included:

Conducting a thorough business analysis.

Developing a comprehensive Business Requirement Document (BRD).

Identifying steps to enhance sales and targeting strategies.

The journey through this analysis provided valuable insights, which are outlined in the uploaded BRD. The document presents a structured approach, detailing the hierarchy of steps taken during the analysis. I encourage you to review it, align with the outlined methodology, and explore how these strategies can be applied effectively.

Thank you for your time, and I hope this project provides useful perspectives!
